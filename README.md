### Support for Python 12

Seems that following error:

```bash
Warning: Invalid configuration encountered
  at 'provider.runtime': must be equal to one of the allowed values [dotnet6, go1.x, java17, java11, java8, java8.al2, nodejs14.x, nodejs16.x, nodejs18.x, nodejs20.x, provided, provided.al2, provided.al2023, python3.7, python3.8, python3.9, python3.10, python3.11, ruby2.7, ruby3.2]

isn't problematic. See [https://forum.serverless.com/t/support-for-python-3-12/19926](https://forum.serverless.com/t/support-for-python-3-12/19926)
